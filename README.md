## Content : R Script for investigating past and present species distribution using MaxEnt (machine learning algorithm). As a part of my master thesis, I analyzed past (1768-1950) and present (1950- mid 2022) plant species distribution to investigate the relationship between climatic changes and species distribution in Switzerland. ##

- "README.txt"          : this file
- scripts : Two scripts are available. One for the distribution mapping with MaxEnt (name: MaxEnt_Script), the other for the niche dynamics using PCA-env (name: nichedyn_Script).  They are two independent, separate analyses using the same dataset. 
- data : 
    - all_data_every_century.txt : herbarium records from Jessica Wang and InfoFlora (see "origin" column)
    - climate data from Noemi Imfeld and Stefan Br√∂nnimann from the Institute of Geography at University of Bern. Please ask them directly. It is an unpublished data set that they are currently working on (last update June 2022).
- Remarks: the data set "all_data_every_century.txt" has been split into two time periods (before 1950 and after 1950) for the MaxEnt analysis and for the niche dynamics plots using PCA-env.
